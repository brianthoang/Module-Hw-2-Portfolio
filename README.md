# Module-Hw-2-Portfolio

For this week's homework, we were given the task of creating a portfolio that included some facts about me, our goals, and our "projects" that we are currently working on. The main focus of this task is to work on the css styling page that helped our portfolio become more engaging to the viewer on any platforms. 

To begin with, I formatted a very basic html portfolio that followed what was demanded to be on. I included my name, some ways to contact me, my social media accounts, and a profile pictures. I then followed this with a nav bar that followed the structure of the main content of the portfolio. I had included code that when you would select one of the nav bar items, the webpage would direct you to the appropriate content. 

Finally with the styling, I had focused on having my webpage be flexible for both small and larger displays. By default, my content was arranged in an upside-down triangle. But if you were to shrink the display, the whole webpage is arranged in a column fashioned. With a larger display, this would be the opposite, as the sizing of the font becomes larger as well as the items being arranged in a row fashioned.
